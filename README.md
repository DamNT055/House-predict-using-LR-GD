## Overview

The purpose of the project is to predict the market value of the property being sold. This program helps to find the starting price of a location based on location variables. Similarly, consider a situation in which a person needs to sell a house. By using a real estate pricing system, the seller will be able to determine what features he can add to the house so that the house can be sold at a higher price. Therefore, in both cases, we can be sure that the home price is good for both the buyer and the seller. Housing prices go up every year, so there is a need for a real estate forecasting system. Estimating the price of a house can help a developer determine the selling price of a house and can help clients set a reasonable time to buy a home.

## Step by step 
_ Load the data set, Select features, Remove
NAs

_ Split it into two parts: 70% of which you will
use to train your model and the remaining data
will be used to test the model.

_ Use Python to analyze data and visualize
images, summarize - DataVisualization.
   +  Explore the dimensions of data
   +  Show some instances from the data 
   +  Do Statistical summary of all attributes
   +  Plot Univariate and Multivariate Plots
   
_ Build and Evaluate Regression Model
   +  Use (mini-batch) Gradient descent to
optimize the parameters
